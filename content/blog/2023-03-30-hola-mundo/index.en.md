If you are a programmer, you surely know the classic greeting **`"Hello, world!"`**. It is the first program we learn to write in any programming language and its only function, making it the most basic program possible, is to _print that simple message on the screen._ And just as this greeting is the first step into the world of programming, this article is for me the first step in starting this small personal space that I had neglected until now.

From the web address and as you might have noticed from many places on this site, you will know that [my name is Ricardo Antonio. I am from Mexico and not long ago, I decided that I wanted to dedicate my time to doing what I love, programming.]({{< ref "/about" >}} "About me") So I started this journey with high expectations. Some have been fulfilled and others not quite as expected, but here I am, enjoying the sights that this wonderful, and sometimes complicated journey has offered me. Also, **learning English is part of this journey.** I'm trying to improve my writing skills, so it's possible that sometimes you won't understand what I'm saying. Please be patient with me.

The topics I write about will be varied, but I will surely share the experiences, knowledge, and skills I acquire that may be useful to others. So, I make no promises about a specific structure or section, but most of what I write in some way will be related to programming and technology and I hope to do it in a conversational tone rather than a technical one.

Like any novice programmer facing "Hello, world!", I am excited about what will come next and the opportunities that await me. As a free space to express myself, I hope my blog can be a place to unleash my ideas and, above all, that they prove to be useful for those who read them.

If you have made it this far, **thank you so much for reading!** I would love to know what you think, so leave me a comment and don't hesitate to follow me on my social networks. _Until the next post!_
