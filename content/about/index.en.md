### Simco Tools

Fullstack project. For the frontend, I used React to create a smooth and intuitive user experience, and to complement this, I implemented libraries like am5 to generate impressive visuals and charts.

In the backend, I used Python with Flask to create APIs that support the application's logic. Additionally, I worked with PostgreSQL databases to store data in a secure and scalable way.
